  <Name>Gunship Bottom</Name>
  <Description>
    Gunship bottom / entrance pad. Uses palette 7 regardless of enemy set. Does not use "speed" nor "Tilemap".
    In enemy population, this enemy must be placed after the gunship top if "speed 2" is zero, or after another gunship bottom if "speed 2" is non-zero.
    
    Sets the "intangible" and "process instruction" bits of initial "special".
    Uses the graphics of the previous enemy in enemy population.
    
    The initial Y position of this enemy is moved 15px upwards.
    If "speed 2" is zero and landing on Zebes from Ceres, Y position is set to 17px above Samus.
    If "speed 2" is non-zero, Y position is set to the gunship top's Y position - 1.
    
    This enemy is primarily driven by the gunship top and only serves to run an instruction list for graphics with no main AI.

    RAM:
        $0FAE: Hover sound effect timer (if "speed 2" is zero) (0..47h)
        $0FB0: Liftoff timer (if "speed 2" is zero) (0..80h).
        $0FB2: Initialised to $A7D7 (RTL). Gunship Y velocity * 100h during liftoff (if "speed 2" is zero).
