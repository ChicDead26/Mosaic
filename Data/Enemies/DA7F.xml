  <Description>
    A blue bug that rises up when samus is nearby. Once it is level with samus, it will charge horizontally at samus, despawning off screen.

    The upward speed can be set at $A3:B4C8 (pixels/frame) and $A3:B4CD (sub pixels/frame).

    Horizontal speed cycles through three states, which can be set at $A3:B419. It is a list of 3 pairs of words (first is px/frame, second is sub px/frame). The amount of frames spent on each speed can be set at:
      speed 1: $A3:B3C3, $A3:B3E9
      speed 2: $A3:B3C9, $A3:B3EF
      speed 3: $A3:B3CF, $A3:B3F0
