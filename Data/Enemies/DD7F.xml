<EnemyInfo>
  <Name>Metroid</Name>
  <Description>
    The Metroid floats around and charges samus. On contact, the Metroid will latch onto samus draining health over time, which can be knocked off with a bomb. If frozen, the metroid is vulnerable to missiles and super missiles. The metroid can also be killed with power bombs.

    The Metroid graphics must be first in the list or the frozen spritemap will not be correct.

    The freeze timer can be modified at $A3:F028.
