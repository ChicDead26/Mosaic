<EnemyInfo>
  <Name>Zebetite</Name>
  <Description>
    Destructable vertical tube that heals over time. Do not include this enemy in the enemy type list, it instead uses the graphics in the Rinka enemy, so make sure that enemy type is included instead. The Rinka palette must be set to 2.

    Zebetite use events to store which walls have been destroyed. This means their kill state persists even on a room reload. This means that only one zebetite is spawned at a time, and the next position zebetite is spawned when the previous is destroyed, so make sure only one is visible at a time.

    The zebetite health can be found at $A6:FC7A and $A6:FC7F.
    The health regeneration per frame is at $A6:FC77.
    The animation changes based on the health remaining. The 4 hp cutoffs can be found at $A6:FD13, $A6:FD1B, $A6:FD23, and $A6:FD2B from high to low.

    There are some lists for the initilization states for the 4 posible states. Each list is 4 words long for the corrosponding states.
      $A6:FC03 ; 0x0000 = 1 piece, 0x8000 = 2 pieces
      $A6:FC0B ; Vertical size radius (pixels)
      $A6:FC1B ; X position
      $A6:FC23 ; Y position - first piece
      $A6:FC2B ; Y position - second piece (only if 2 pieces)
