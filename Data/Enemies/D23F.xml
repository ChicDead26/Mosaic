        If 0, the rinka will always spawn where you have placed it. Otherwise, the game will keep spawning it wherever it thinks is good for trolling Samus (could be anywhere).
        Speed 1-3 are used in MBs room to teleport the rinkas around the room to follow Samus without having 9 rinkas actually placed in the room and running off screen.
        It will only make sense in a room with MB's room's layout.
