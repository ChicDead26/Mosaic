  <Name>Ki-Hunter Wings C</Name>
  <Description>
    Wing part for Ki-Hunters. The wing enemy must immediate follow the Ki-Hunter, and should be at the same position. The enemy type for the wings should be ommitted. Even if the Ki-Hunter is initially flightless, the wing enemy should be included anyways.

    There are three versions of the Ki-Hunter Wings, but they are all identical, and can be interchanged if desired. They do not contain the wing graphics, so it has no effect which one is used.
