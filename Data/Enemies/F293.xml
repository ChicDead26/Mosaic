    Hole locations list at $B3:949B:
      List of 4 holes, each with the format
      (x-4, x+4, y-4, y+4)

    Speed Table at $B3:94BB:
      The speed * trail should be the same for all speed levels in order to prevent botwoom from stretching out as the speed increases

      speed, trail
      0002,  0018 ; normal hp
      0003,  0010 ; half hp
      0004,  000C ; quarter hp

    AI RNG Table at $B3:988D:
      List of 8 values
      move = 98EC
      shoot = 9913
      The first value should be move

    Movement table at $B3:E150:
      List of 32 movement possibilities (each 8 bytes)
      The index used is:
        (RNG{0-3} * 8) + (hole{0-3} * 32) + (alternate{0-1} * 128)
      Each movement item is:
        (path, direction, hole, 0000)
        - Direction is either 0000 for forward or FFFF for reverse. When moving reverse the path is read in reverse order, so the pointer should start at the end.
        - Hole is the hole index * 8

    Path data at $B3:A058:
      Path data is pointed to from the movement table items. The data can be genenerated using the tool at https://forum.metroidconstruction.com/index.php/topic,4834.0.html
