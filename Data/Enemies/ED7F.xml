<EnemyInfo>
  <Name>Dead Sidehopper</Name>
  <Description>
    Dead sidehopper that will decay when interacted with. This enemy's graphics are used for the other "Dead" enemies (except the Torizo), so use this enemy in the enemy type for them instead of their normal ones.

    This enemy has an alternate alive version that is killed by the Super Metroid. If this alternate version is used, the Dead Sidehopper (Alive GFX) enemy must be included in the enemy types to load the proper graphics. The pallete for both this and the alternate in the enemy types should be set the 7.

    The alive version has a hardcoded starting position which can be modified at:
      $A9:D7FA ; X Position in pixels
      $A9:D800 ; Y Position in pixels

    Only 1 of each type can be used in a room. If there are multiple enemies with the same type, they incorrectly share decay animations.
