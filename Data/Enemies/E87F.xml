  <Name>Beetom</Name>
  <Description>
	The grasshopper-like enemy that latches onto Samus and drains her health. 
	Speed/Speed2 are unused, and setting the Tilemap value has no effect.
	
	Beetom's Main AI has a list of functions that it can execute, generally running one per frame based on $0FAC,x (aka "Next AI Pointer")
	The following is a description of the purpose of most of those functions:
		$B814: Initial Main AI: Next AI = $B82F if Samus is not near, $B90F otherwise.
		$B82F: Select a random idle jump (or crawl?).
		$B84F: $0FAE,x = #$0020. Next AI = $B9B2.
		$B85F: Setup for $B9C1
		$B873: Setup for $BA24
		$B887: Setup for $BA84
		$B8A9: Setup for $BAB7
		$B8CB: Setup for $BB55
		$B8ED: Setup for $BB88
		$B90F: Begin aggressive leap toward Samus. Next AI = $BC26 or $BC5A.
		$B952: Setup for $BCF8
		$B966: Setup for $BD42
		$B97A: Setup for $BD9D
		$B9A2: Setup for $BDC5 (enemy touch AI)
		$B9B2: Wait until $0FAE,x is zero, then go to InitialMainAI
		$B9C1: Enemy is crawling left on the ground.
		$BA24: Enemy is crawling right on the ground.
		$BA84: Idly jumping upward, facing left.
		$BAB7: Idly jumping upward, facing right.
		$BB55: Idly jumping upward, facing left (higher jump).
		$BB88: Idly jumping upward, facing right (higher jump).
		$BC26: Aggressively leaping at Samus, facing left.
		$BC5A: Aggressively leaping at Samus, facing right.
		$BCF8: Latched onto Samus from the right (after jumping left)
		$BD42: Latched onto Samus from the left (after jumping right)
