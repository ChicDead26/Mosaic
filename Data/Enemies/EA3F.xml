    <Property>
      <Name>Pattern</Name>
      <Description>The pattern that the spark does. Flashing will alternate on and off based on the delay. It will spend 8 more frames off than specified. Dropping will spawn a falling spark projectile after every delay period. 

      The falling sparks have a random horizontal speed which can be modified at $86:F3D4. It's a list a 7 pairs of words, the first is pixels/frame, the second is sub-pixels/frame.

      If random delay is set, it will choose a random number and mask with 0x003F for the number of frames. This can be modified at $A8:E700. Keep in mind that this is a bit mask, so using a value like 0x00F0 would be between 0 and 240, and is a multiple of 16.</Description>
