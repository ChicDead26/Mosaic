<EnemyInfo>
  <Name>Etecoon</Name>
  <Description>
    Harmless monkey creatures that can wall jump back and forth. There are 3 versions of the enemy, but they are not a multipart enemy, so multiples can be included and the order does not matter. The first version plays the initial music, so it's recommended to have only 1 of those.

    The etecoons will activate once samus is within 8 tiles horizontal distance (which can be modified at $A7:E9BB, word value in pixels). The etecoons will start moving once samus is withing 4 tiles horizontal distance (modified at $A7:EE49 and $A7:EA56). The etecoons get stunned when an earthquake is active.
