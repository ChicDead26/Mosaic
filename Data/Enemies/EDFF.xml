  <Name>Dead Geemer</Name>
  <Description>
    Dead geemer that will decay when interacted with. This enemy's graphics is in the Dead Sidehopper enemy, so that enemy should be in the enemy types instead of this one. Palette should be set to 7.

    Only 1 of each direction can be used in a room. If there are multiple enemies with the same direction, they incorrectly share decay animations. This is why there are two versions of the ceiling geemer, so that two ceiling types can be used at once.
